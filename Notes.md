**🔍 What is Syntax in Programming?**

Syntax refers to the set of rules that define the correct structure of statements in a programming language. Just like grammar rules in a spoken language, syntax rules determine how code should be written so the compiler or interpreter can understand and execute it.

**When is a Statement considered Invalid?**

❌ A statement becomes invalid if it violates the syntax rules of the programming language. For example:

    Missing semicolons (in C/C++/Java)
    
    Incorrect indentation (in Python)
    
    Using undeclared variables
    
    Incorrect function or loop structure

**💬 Statement vs. Syntax**
Statement: A single instruction written by the user in code (e.g., print("Hello")).

Syntax: The rule that defines how that statement must be written.

Not every statement the user writes is valid — the interpreter or compiler checks each one against the language's syntax rules.

**⚠️  When Are Syntax Errors Reported?**

Compiled Languages (like C, Java):

    Syntax errors are usually caught at compile time.

Interpreted Languages (like Python, JavaScript):

    Syntax errors are often reported during runtime — unless the code is parsed beforehand.

**✅ Improved Version of Your Explanation:**
In programming, syntax is a set of rules that defines how code must be written. Whatever the user writes in a programming language is considered a statement.

However, the interpreter or compiler does not always accept the statements written by the user. It checks whether the statement follows the syntax rules of the language.

If the syntax is incorrect, the statement is marked as invalid. Some interpreters report syntax errors at runtime, while compilers typically catch them during compilation.
